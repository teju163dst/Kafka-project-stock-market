# Kafka-project-stock-market
# In this project real time stock market data is streamed on AWS S3 using Apache kafka. After setting up Kafka zookeeper in your local machine you first build a producer and consumer. Due to real time streaming functionalty of Kafka clusters the changes added in producer each time get reflected in consumer. In this way real time data streaming is achieved.
